NullifyBlanks
=============

This plugin makes ActiveRecord write blank strings as null to 
nullable columns in the database rather than zero length strings.

Just drop the plugin into your plugins folder and that's all there 
is to it. There's a rake task to nullify zero length strings in 
existing records if required.
